# WorkspaceSort README

WorkspaceSort adds the ability to sort workspace-folders in the same way as files and inner-folders are sorted. There are two ways to sort your workspace folders:
* Right-click on a folder in your explorer and click `Sort Workspace Folders`.
* Open the Command-palette and type `Sort Workspace Folders`.

## Release Notes

### 1.0.0

Initial release of WorkspaceSort. In this version it is possible to sort your workspace folders in alphabetical order, either by using the context-menu on a folder or by typing the command. No difference is made between uppercase and lowercase characters when sorting.
