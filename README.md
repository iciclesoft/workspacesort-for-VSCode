# WorkspaceSort

WorkspaceSort adds the ability to sort workspace-folders in the same way as files and inner-folders are sorted. There are two ways to sort your workspace folders:
* Right-click on a folder in your explorer and click `Sort Workspace Folders`.
* Open the Command-palette and type `Sort Workspace Folders`.

# Installation

To install the extension, press Ctrl-P or Cmd-P (Mac) in VSCode and execute the following command:
